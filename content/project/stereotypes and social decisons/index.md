In order to study SES stereotyping in a diverse population, I recently completed the first CMORR study with an online community sample. In this work, funded by a grant I received from Oregon Consumer Justice, I recruited participants (N = 303) from Prolific. People from across the US told each other about a negative consumer experience before providing judgments about their partner’s SES and personality, their interest in affiliating with their partner, and the credibility of their partner’s consumer complaint. I am currently conducting the preregistered analyses with this data and look forward to reporting what SES-based stereotyping looks like in a diverse population. Moreover, the results from this study will test the hypothesis that perceptions of SES are associated with social decisions that have important consequences for reifying group boundaries and perpetuating inequality.
