In this line of research, I aim to answer fundamental questions about the impressions people form of one anotherâ€™s  personality traits and other characteristics after social interactions. I am especially interested in how impressions are biased by other factors. In one study, I showed that people bias impressions of others towards similarity by eliciting similar behavior from others.
