abstract: "Research on impressions and social interactions has predominately examined perceptions of artificial stimuli or those made by convenience samples of undergraduates. In the present work, we introduce and validate a new experimental method, the Computer-Mediated Online Round Robin (CMORR), with the aim of providing researchers a tool to extend the study of inter- personal phenomena to more diverse populations. We describe the method and provide guidance for future CMORR studies. We collected CMORR data from an undergraduate sample (N = 171), and compared the structure and accuracy of impressions of Big Five personality trait to two in-person studies; one with group interactions (N = 225), one with dyadic interactions (N = 511), and meta-analytic estimates from the literature. The results showed a general correspondence between impressions formed in online interactions and in in-person contexts. The findings support using CMORR to study general questions about impressions and social interactions."
