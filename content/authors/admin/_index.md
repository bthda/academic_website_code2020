Hi, I am currently a researcher in Dr. Nicholas Rule's [Social Perception and Cognition Lab](https://psdlab.uoregon.edu) at the University of Toronto. 

In my research, I draw on the methods and theories of interpersonal perception, personality science, and social cognition to study impressions formed during social interactions. I develop and test models to understand how various factors—such as context and social identity—affect impressions and influence key social decisions, like whom to befriend or trust. Put differently, I study social cognition in context with the goal of understanding the interpersonal forces that maintain social and economic inequality. My work is organized in three overlapping areas: 1) SES measurement and its effects on psychological functioning, 2) interpersonal perception of personality traits, and 3) interpersonal stereotypes and social outcomes. 

An integral part of this work has been developing novel experimental and analytic approaches needed to examine these phenomena in social interactions between real people from diverse populations.

I also practice open science ([OSF page](https://osf.io/p9vv3/)), and have a interest in philosophy of science, research and quantitative methods.
