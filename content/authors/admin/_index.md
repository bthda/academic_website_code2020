Dr. Bradley T. Hughes is an Assistant Professor of IO Psychology in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/psychological-brain-sciences.html). 

Dr. Hughes's research draws on the methods and theories of interpersonal 
perception, personality science, and social cognition to better understand the 
impressions people form of one another during social interactions, how these 
impressions are biased by factors such as context and social identity, and how this 
in turn affects interpersonal decisions and judgments like trust and affiliation. He 
studies these psychological phenomena in real-world social interactions with the 
goal of understanding how interpersonal forces contribute to the maintenance of 
social and economic inequality. He is particularly interested in how biased 
impressions inhibit upward economic mobility in the context of hiring and 
promotion decisions.

An integral part of this work research is developing novel experimental and 
analytic approaches needed to examine these phenomena in social interactions 
between real people from diverse populations.

Dr. Hughes practices open science. Study materials, data, and analysis code are 
available on the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/p9vv3/)). He is also interested in 
philosophy of science, research methods, and quantitative modeling.
